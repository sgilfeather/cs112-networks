# cs112-networks
Network architecture work: TCP and UDP-based network programs written in C. Implementations of proxies, FTP applications, chat servers, and much more...

Included in this repo are projects completed for this course, including:
- `A0 Cache`: A simple cache for text and binary files, which takes HTTP-esque `PUT` and `GET` requests from a command file to cache files.
- `A1 HTTP Proxy`: An HTTP Proxy with local file caching, built on a TCP architecture. 
- `A3 FTP Application`: An FTP application for retrieving files from the FTP server's local machine, built on a UDP architecture.
- `Requestify`: A music streaming service, which retrieves songs from SoundCloud and generates themed radio channels for clients to listen to.

For the sake of academic integrity, I unfortunately can't make my code for these projects public. However, I can share their specifications and design documents here. If you (a recruiter, a curious developer, etc.) would like to see the source code, shoot me an email at **skylar.gilfeather@gmail.com**. I'd be very happy to share my work with you!
